Jean-Louis was a 25-year old virgin when a free-spirited young Parisian woman was temporarily stranded in his village after a bus broke down. She left him a changed man, and she also left a match book from a fast food restaurant called Fast Burger. Soon after his grandfather passes away, the innocent rube Jean-Louis hops on his bike and embarks upon a quest to Paris to find this enigmatic woman. But he is not prepared for the size of Paris, and instead ends up working at a Fast Burger outlet himself. Jean-Louis is a simple soul and freely expresses himself without guile. For some reason this endears him to the staff and management; soon he has been promoted into the upper echelons of the company. One day he meets a rather ditzy Metro security guard, Henriette, who is also at sea in the big city. The kindred spirits click and a sweet romance ensues.","release_date":"1995-01-01","genre_ids":[],"id":325334,"original_title":"Fast","original_language":"en","title":"Fast","backdrop_path":null,"popularity":1.000143,"vote_count":0,"video":false,"vote_average":0},{"poster_path":"\/dCgm7efXDmiABSdWDHBDBx2jwmn.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for his comatose brother.","release_date":"2015-04-01","genre_ids":[28],"id":168259,"original_title":"Furious 7","original_language":"en","title":"Furious 7","backdrop_path":"\/ypyeMfKydpyuuTMdp36rMlkGDUL.jpg","popularity":10.266223,"vote_count":3531,"video":false,"vote_average":7.3},{"poster_path":"\/9y5rSeO0xH3m5oRJmhBusDkiS0j.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Follows a group of high school students growing up in southern California, based on the real-life adventures chronicled by Cameron Crowe.
